# Data-Collecion
Code for generating Skill Learning Networks: Model and Dataset 

We have created two pipelines for Data Collection: 1) Without Perception (or directly from simulator) and  2) With Perception (Image based Data Collection)

# Skill-Networks
We have created two models for Skill Learning: 1) Without Physics/Data Driven, 2) With Physics and Data Driven provided governing equations are known, and 3) With Physics only
