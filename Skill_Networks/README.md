# Data-Collecion
Code for generating Skill Learning Networks: Model and Dataset 

We have created two pipelines for Data Collection: 1) Without Perception (or directly from simulator) and  2) With Perception (Image based Data Collection)

## Installation
Follow the installation process for [Isaac Gym](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym). We recommend setting up a dedicated conda environment. No other installation is required.

## Activating Environment
Run commands in `setup.sh`
