# Skill-Learning Model
Code for Skill Learning Networks

We have created two models for Skill Learning: 1) Without Physics/Data Driven (nn) and  2) With Physics and Data Driven (pidnn)


Note: Each of the skills: sliding, throwing, swinging have both pinn and nn skill model available where as skills: hitting and bouncing have only nn mode available.

## Run 
Run `python *_driver.py` along with desired configurations in respective config for data generation.
